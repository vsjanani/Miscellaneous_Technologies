git:

cloning is downloading code from repository for the first time.

to get updates from the same repository, "pull" has to be used instead of "clone"

git:

first time user to create new repository and push code:
git config --global user.name "vsjanani"
git config --global user.email "jansree90@gmail.com"
cd pythonproject #path to upload in git
git init #.git file will be created to store github reference and notes.
git add * #to add all the files in the path selected to stash or staging. - stage 1 of commit.
git status #to check if all the files are added.
git commit -m "my first commit" #files are now commited and ready to push. github only selects commited files to push.
git remote add origin *github repository path* #this path is present in the repository created. this is make connection between repository created with local files located path.
git push origin master #pushes code from local to repository's master branch.

To download the repository for the first time:
git clone *github repository path*
regular user:
cd file path.
git add *
git commit -m "message" (-m (once again) for "detailed message") or git commit and click enter to open editor for detailed message and click esc followed by :wq to save and close the editor window.
git push origin master or git pull origin master

Branches:

If completed, sub-branch code will get merged with master branch.

cd file path
git checkout -b branchname #create new branch
git branch #to check which branch we are in.
git add *
git commit -m message
git push origin branchname
git checkout branchname #to jump to existing branch.
