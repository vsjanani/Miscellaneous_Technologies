where vs having:

where is used to condition before group by whereas having is used after group by.
having can use aliases whereas where cannot use alaises for condition.

group by vs partition by:

# user$raw
6 rows:
name number_of_registered_entities
User_1 | 8
User_2 | 10
User_3 | 8
User_2 | 1
User_3 | 5
User_1 | 7

# SQL query 1
GROUP BY:
SELECT name, SUM(number_of_registered_entities)entitysum from user$raw
GROUP BY name

# Output 1 
3 rows:
name entitysum
User_1 | 15
User_2 | 11
User_3 | 13

# SQL query 2
PARTITION BY:
SELECT SUM(number_of_registered_entities) OVER (PARTITION BY name) AS name, entitysum FROM user$raw

# Output 2
6 rows:
name entitysum
User_1 | 15
User_1 | 15
User_2 | 11
User_2 | 11
User_3 | 13
User_3 | 13

To show tables:
show tables;

To get details about table:
explain tableName;

There are other direct keywords like intersect which is used for two queries not a single query.
eg:
select * from customer intersect select * from orders;

difference between rownumber, rank and dense_rank:
StyleID     ID       RANK      ROW_NUMBER      DENSE_RANK
----------- -------- --------- --------------- ----------
1           1        1         1               1
1           1        1         2               1
1           1        1         3               1
1           2        4         4               2

SELECT *,
row_number() over(order by age) cus
FROM customer;

replace row_number by rank() or dense_rank()

basically, rank is just like school rank. same values (defined insed order by) gets same rank 1st.
hence 2nd rank will be skipped and 3rd rank will be mapped to next record.
